# wiki-pages

This project creates a website of static wiki pages, with the content stored in **markdown** format.
Some features include:
- A search bar to search for an individual wiki page, which can also render similar results if the exact search query is not found.
- A random page option which can take you to a random wiki page.
- An option to edit a page from within the web interface.
